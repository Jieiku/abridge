# Abridge Zola Theme

Abridge is a fast and lightweight Zola theme using semantic html, only ~6kb css before the svg icons and syntax highlighting css, no mandatory JS[*](https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge#contributing-and-philosophy), and perfect [Lighthouse](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=abridge.netlify.app), [YellowLabTools](https://yellowlab.tools/), and [Observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/abridge.netlify.app) scores.

There is also [Abridge-minimal](https://github.com/jieiku/abridge.css) Theme which is used to showcase the [abridge.css framework](https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge.css/tree/master/dist)

## Requirements

This theme requires version 0.17.1 or later of [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/)

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jieiku/abridge.git
cd abridge
zola serve
# open http://127.0.0.1:1111/ in the browser
```

## Installation
The Quick Start shows how to run the theme directly as a site.
Next we will use abridge as a theme to a NEW site.

### Step 1: Create a new zola site

```bash
zola init mysite
```

### Step 2: Install abridge

Download this theme to your themes directory:

```bash
cd mysite/themes
git clone https://github.com/jieiku/abridge.git
```

Or install as a submodule:

```bash
cd mysite
git init  # if your project is a git repository already, ignore this command
git submodule add https://github.com/jieiku/abridge.git themes/abridge
```

### Step 3: Configuration

Copy the `config.toml` from the theme directory to your project's root directory:
(This will give you a base configuration with all config values used)
If you plan to use the search_facade feature (dynamic ondemand loading of search) then also copy the package.json (and netlify.toml if you use netlify)
You will also want to copy the content/static folder if you intend to use stork or tinysearch

```bash
cp themes/abridge/config.toml config.toml
cp themes/abridge/package.json package.json
cp themes/abridge/netlify.toml netlify.toml
cp -r themes/abridge/content/static content/
```

Uncomment the theme line:
```bash
sed -i 's/^#theme = "abridge"/theme = "abridge"/' config.toml
```

### Step 4: Add new content

You can copy the content from the theme directory to your project:

```bash
cp -r themes/abridge/content .
```

You can modify or add new posts in the content directory as needed.

### Step 5: Run the project

Just run `zola serve` in the root path of the project:

```bash
zola serve
```

Zola will start the development web server making your site accessible by default at
`http://127.0.0.1:1111`. Saved changes will live reload in the browser.

### Step 6: Add provisions for search_facade.js (dynamic ondemand loading of search related js) or disable the facade.

**IMPORTANT!** by default abridge dynamically loads the js related to the search when the search box is clicked, this allows for a faster page load and saved bandwidth. (not everyone needs or will use the search!)

This feature uses a bundle that has all js related to the search in a single js file, this ensures that the files are in the proper order, and that once downloaded the search is ready to use.

to generate this file you have to do this:

```shell
zola build
npm run abridge
zola build # or zola serve
```

or if testing/running the theme directly:

```shell
zola build
npm run abridge-demo
zola build # or zola serve
```

I completely understand that this makes configuration a bit complicated. Zola does not have any built-in facilities for bundling javascript so we are using uglifyjs, shasum, openssl, etc (all defined in package.json) If you find this too difficult then I highly suggest just disabling the facade and loading the search index with the rest of the page:

You can disable the facade (dynamic loading of search) in the config.toml:

```toml
js_search_facade = false
```

The Abridge demo uses netlify, and the included package.json and netlify.toml files handle this extra bundle step for us automatically.

An overview of this logic is this:

```shell
zola build # just to generate search_index.en.js
uglifyjs to create search_bundle.min.js # all search related files
update sha256 hash and base64 encoded sha384 hash in search_facade.js file for cachebust and subresource integrity
uglifyjs to create abridge-bundle.min.js to include search_facade.js with the new hashes.
zola build to update the hashes for abridge-bundle.min.js
```

If you plan to use the included netlify.toml file you should change the following:
```toml
command = "zola build && npm run abridge-demo && zola build"
```

to this:
```toml
command = "zola build && npm run abridge && zola build"
```

### Step 7: Switch Search library (optional)

Abridge by default uses elasticlunr for the search library (zola's default), but both tinysearch and stork are supported search libraries.

tinysearch demo: https://jieiku.github.io/abridge-tinysearch/

stork demo: https://jieiku.github.io/abridge-stork/

**Switch to tinysearch:**

First you have to install tinysearch so that you can build the index:
(you also need to download the latest stork.wasm into the abridge static folder)

```shell
sudo pacman -S install wasm-pack binaryen
git clone https://github.com/tinysearch/tinysearch
cd tinysearch
cargo build --release
sudo cp ./target/release/tinysearch /usr/local/bin/tinysearch
exit # reload shell environment

cd ~/.dev/abridge/static
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/jameslittle230/stork/releases/latest | grep "browser_download_url.*stork.wasm" | cut -d : -f 2,3 | tr -d \" | wget -i -
```

Switch abridge to tinysearch:

```shell
cd ~/.dev/abridge
sed -i 's/^search_library =.*/search_library = "tinysearch"/' config.toml
sed -i 's/^draft =.*/draft = true/' content/static/stork_toml.md
sed -i 's/^draft =.*/draft = false/' content/static/tinysearch_json.md
zola build
tinysearch --optimize --path static public/data_tinysearch/index.html
# zola serve
```

**Switch to stork:**

First you have to install stork so that you can build the index:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jameslittle230/stork
cd stork
cargo build --release
sudo cp ./target/release/stork /usr/local/bin/stork

exit # reload shell environment
```

Switch abridge to stork:

```shell
cd ~/.dev/abridge
sed -i 's/^search_library =.*/search_library = "stork"/' config.toml
sed -i 's/^draft =.*/draft = false/' content/static/stork_toml.md
sed -i 's/^draft =.*/draft = true/' content/static/tinysearch_json.md
zola build
stork build --input public/data_stork/index.html --output static/stork.st
# zola serve
```

**Switch back to elasticlunr:**

abridge as a theme:
```shell
cd ~/.dev/abridge
sed -i 's/^search_library =.*/search_library = false/' config.toml
sed -i 's/^draft =.*/draft = true/' themes/abridge/content/static/stork_toml.md
sed -i 's/^draft =.*/draft = true/' themes/abridge/content/static/tinysearch_json.md
zola build
npm run abridge
zola build
# zola serve
```

abridge theme directly:
```shell
cd ~/.dev/abridge
sed -i 's/^search_library =.*/search_library = false/' config.toml
sed -i 's/^draft =.*/draft = true/' content/static/stork_toml.md
sed -i 's/^draft =.*/draft = true/' content/static/tinysearch_json.md
zola build
npm run abridge-demo
zola build
# zola serve
```

## Customization

You can customize your configurations, templates and content for yourself. Look
at the `config.toml`, `content` files, and templates files in this
repo for an idea.

### Number of Items per page for pagination

To change the number of items per page edit: `abridge/content/_index.md` and change the value for `paginate_by`

### Page width

You can set the overal page width by editing `themes\abridge\sass\_variables.scss` file, and adjusting these two lines:

```scss
$mw:50% !default;// max-width
$mb:1200px !default;// value at which to switch from fluid layout to using max-width
```

### Colors and Styles

Colors and style are handled by the sass files of [abridge.css](https://github.com/jieiku/abridge.css)

Abridge comes with "Skins" each with their own auto, dark, light and switcher modes.
Auto mode automatically displays a dark or light version depending on browser/OS settings.
Switcher mode automatically displays a dark or light version depending on browser/OS settings, and has a user clickable theme switcher, but it requires additional javascript.

The skin used on [the Demo](https://abridge.netlify.app/) uses primarily orange colors.
It is defined here: `/themes/abridge/sass/abridge-switcher.scss`

There is also other variations, that you will see defined in this same directory, they are also all defined in config.toml

To change colors or fonts all you need to do is edit these files or duplicate them and create your own skin.
Then in the root of your site type `zola build` which will regenerate your site, this is similar to what zola serve does, except it does not facilitate serving the site.

### Javascript Files, js_bundle and options

These are the javascript files currently used by Abridge:

- search_index.en.js: search index generated by zola at each build for elasticlunr.
- elasticlunr.min.js: search library for client side searching.
- search.js: to make use of elasticlunr from our sites search box for both suggestions and the results page.
- search_facade.js: used to dynamically load a bundle containing all search related js ONLY when the search box is clicked. (on-demand)
- email.js: uses javascript to obfuscate your real email address for the mail icon at the bottom of the page.
- codecopy.js: add a Copy Button to code blocks, to copy contents of the code block to clipboard.
- theme.js: very tiny script to facilitate local storage for the theme switcher. (never bundle, gets loaded separate)
- theme_button.js: tiny script for the theme switcher function when you click the theme switch button.
- prestyle.js: Used to preload css files `<link rel="preload"` - this script changes these to `<link rel="stylesheet"` once the page has finished loading, this allows us to load stylesheets for external fonts, fontawesome, or katex in a non blocking fashion.

js_bundle is set to a javascript file with a bundle of multiple javascript files, this allows us to serve fewer javascript files (only the search index and the bundle, or if using the facade all the js related features minus the search related files). Included are a few of the likely most commonly used combinations, but you can generate any combination of js features into a bundle yourself using uglifyjs if you need to, there are examples in the config.toml (or in package.json), eg:

`uglifyjs prestyle.js theme_button.js elasticlunr.min.js search.js -c -m -o abridge-nofacade.min.js`

All Bundles are defined in [package.json](https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge/blob/master/package.json)

A Bundle can be generated from the package.json scripts using npm, for example:

`npm run noswitchernosearch`

Abridge Default Bundle:
- abridge-bundle.min.js: includes: prestyle, theme_button, search_facade, email, codecopy

Abridge Alternate Bundles:
- abridge.min.js: includes: prestyle, search_facade, email, codecopy (same as default but without the theme switcher)
- abridge-bundle-nofacade.min.js: includes: prestyle, theme_button, email, codecopy, elasticlunr, search
- abridge-bundle-noswitcher.min.js - includes: prestyle, email, codecopy, elasticlunr, search
- abridge-bundle-nosearch.min.js - includes: prestyle, theme_button, email, codecopy
- abridge-bundle-noswitchernosearch.min.js - includes: prestyle, email, codecopy
- abridge-searchonly.min.js - includes: elasticlunr, search

Support Files:
- theme.min.js (not a bundle, just a minification of theme.js)
- katexbundle.min.js - includes: katex.min.js mathtex-script-type.min.js katex-auto-render.min.js katexoptions.js
- search_bundle.min.js: includes: search_index.en, elasticlunr, search (loaded on demand by search_facade)

### Global Configuration

There are some configuration options that you can customize in `config.toml`.

#### Configuration options before `extra` options

Set the authors's taxonomies for the site.

```toml
taxonomies = [
  {name = "authors"},
]
```

Use search function for the content.

```toml
build_search_index = true
```

â€‹The search is the only essential thing that requires javascript in this this theme.

If you set `build_search_index` to false then the javascript file will no longer be loaded.

The default elasticlunr search is currently used, I may eventually switch this out for something else.

#### Configuration options under the `extra`

Most Options in the config.toml are self documenting, meaning between the name of the config value and the notes in the file it is usually obvious what an option is for.

The following options should be under the `[extra]` in `config.toml`

- `uglyurls` - Set to true, as well as set a file path for base_url to support a local offline mode of your site, you can then browse your site directly from disk.
- `language_code` - Set the site language_code.

- `title_addition` - a default value for title addition, used at the index.
- `recent = true` - This enabled the Recent posts box visible on the top right.
- `recent_items = 9` - The number of items to display in the recent posts box
- `author` - Used for articles to denote the author.

- `footer_size` - Size of the Footer Font: s95, s90, s85, s80, s75, s70, false(full size)
- `footer_credit = true` - This enables the powered by zola and abridge line in the footer.
- `footer_credit_override` - Can be used to customize the footer credit, useful to add icons to the text, etc.
- `logo = { file="logo.svg", width="42", height="42", alt="Abridge", text="bridge" }` - Defines the graphical logo with optional text to follow the logo.
- `textlogo` - A purely Text based logo, this will be used if logo is commented out, if both are commented out then config.title is used.
- `sitedesc` - This adds the site description just below the text based logo.
- `copyright_start_year` - Optionally define a start year for the copyright, otherwise the current year is used.

- `foothr` - Display a horizontal rule above footer
- `menu` - This is an array of links to display at the top right corner of the page
- `menu_footer` - This is an array of links to display in the footer of the page

- `security_header_referrer` - This is mostly used for tracking, the default is set to "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" [info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy)
- `security_header_csp` - Content Security policy, to enfore security rules: [observatory](https://observatory.mozilla.org), [csp-google](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/)

- `integrity` - Useful to set false during development, should normally be set to true.
- `js_bundle` - Useful to set false during javascript development, should normally be set to true.
- `js_switcher` - Set to false to disable the theme switcher.

- `js_prestyle` - The script file used to preload: FontAwesome, Katex, external Google Fonts.
- `js_codecopy` - The script file used to copy the code in code blocks.
- `js_email` - The script file used to obfuscate the email link in footer.
- `js_theme` - Used for the Theme Switcher, to facilitate localstorage.
- `js_themeButton` - Used for the Theme Switcher.

- `stylesheets = [ "abridge-switcher.css" ]` - The stylesheet file(s) to include in the header.

- `banner` - Image to use in seo related cards, this will be the fallback image if the individual articles does not provide one.
- `favicon_...` - Used to set the various favicons (displayed in bookmarks and active browser tab)
- `icon_...` - Used to set the various icons used on the site.
- `fontawesome =` - Uncomment to enable fontawesome library, this will include the file in the header.
    * `icon_read` - icon to display in meta info on index and posts, comment out to disable
    * `icon_date` - icon to display in meta info on index and posts, comment out to disable
    * `icon_info` - icon to display in meta info on index and posts, comment out to disable
    * `icon_author` - icon to display in meta info on index and posts, comment out to disable

- `fonts =` - Uncomment to load external fonts, they will be loaded in the header.
- `math` - Set to true to load the Katex library, enabling the use of the [katex shortcode](https://abridge.netlify.app/overview-math/) (recommend setting on a per page basis instead.)
- `math_auto_render` - This allows you to define a section of math notation using only $$ $$ symbols instead of using the katex shortcode directly. (recommend setting on a per page basis instead.)

- `katex_css`, `katex_js`, `mathtex_js`, `katex_autorender_js`, `katex_options` - Used for Math Notation.
- `katex_bundle` - Used to bundle all of the math related js.

- `keywords =` - This is used for SEO.
- `seo =` - This is used for SEO, for the social media related tags, eg: opengraph, facebook, twitter if set to false it disables them all.
- `extra.social` - These are the options for the social icons in the footer, and a couple are also used in SEO related meta tags.

Additionally you should configure which social icons you plan to use. (makes the css file size smaller)

open `themes/abridge/sass/_variables.scss`

To simply turn them all off you can set `$enable-icons: false`
Otherwise to turn on only the ones you need you would set `$enable-icons: true`
Then enable only the icons you need, eg for mail you would set `$icon-mail: true`
You should then disable all the icons that you do not use, as this will decrease the final size of your css file.
The difference in size is NOT a lot, without icons its ~4kb, with all the social icons its ~12kb.
There are also some general purpose icons you can use, they are disabled by default.

The theme requires tags and categories taxonomies to be enabled in your `config.toml`:

```toml
taxonomies = [
    # You can enable/disable RSS
    {name = "categories", rss = true},
    {name = "tags", rss = true},
]
```

### Top and Footer menus
Set a field in `extra` with a key of `menu` and `menu_footer`.
If a link should have a trailing slash at the end of the url set `slash = true`.

```toml
# This is the default menu
menu = [
    {url = "/", name = "Home", slash = true},
    {url = "/about/", name = "About", slash = true},
    {url = "/posts/", name = "Posts", slash = true},
    {url = "/categories/", name = "Categories", slash = true},
    {url = "/tags/", name = "Tags", slash = true},
]
menu_footer = [
    {url = "/", name = "Home", slash = true},
    {url = "/about/", name = "About", slash = true},
    {url = "/contact/", name = "Contact", slash = true},
    {url = "/privacy/", name = "Privacy", slash = true},
    {url = "/sitemap.xml", name = "Sitemap", slash = false},
]
```

### SEO and Header Tags

Most SEO Tags have been added as well as some important head tags for browser compatibility.

You can review the SEO tags in the head macro located at `templates/macros/head.html`, all configurable values should be in config.toml under config.extra or in the content markdown files.

In your post markdown file you should set a title less than 60 characters and a description between 80 and 160 characters in length. The description is what is displayed in search results below the page title. Anywhere that you do not set a page description, the primary site config.description will be used instead.

You should also set page specific keywords unless your keywords defined in config.toml suffice, any keywords that you add to the page are in addition to the ones defined in config.toml, so do not add those same keywords to your page keywords.

You can optionally also set a page specific image for search results by using page.extra.thumbnail. OpenGraph recommends 1200 x 630 (1.9:1). Twitter recommends 2:1 for large and 1:1 for small. If you do not set a page specific thumbnail then the banner defined in config.toml will be used instead.

Refer to [overview-images](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jieiku/abridge/master/content/overview-images/index.md) for an example:
```md
+++
title = "Image Shortcodes"
description = "Images can be embedded directly using markdown `![Ferris](ferris.svg)`, but using a shortcode prevents CLS by explicitly setting the width and height."
date = 2021-05-19

[taxonomies]
categories = ["Features"]
tags = ["shortcodes","images"]
[extra]
toc = true
keywords = "Image, Markdown, Shortcodes, Hover"
thumbnail = "ferris-gesture.png"
+++
```

There are tools you can use to test your page SEO metadata, such as: [smallseotools.com](https://smallseotools.com/meta-tags-analyzer/)

### KaTeX Math Notation

KaTeX can be used to display complex mathematics, it is a "Fast math typesetting for the web."

You can see a demo on [this page](https://abridge.netlify.app/overview-math/).

I recommend only enabling math on a per page bases in your post.md files, instead of in your main config.toml file.

### Templates

All pages extend to `base.html`, and you can customize them as need.

## Optional Performance Optimizations:

### Abridge.woff2 Icon Font

By default Abridge uses SVG icons directly in CSS, `abridge/sass/include/_icons.scss`, this very efficient and results in the least requests, additionally noscript does not block these resources.

The Abridge.woff2 Icon Font is a subset of Font Awesome, it is still included but not used by default because noscript addon blocks loading of font resources.

If you still want to use font icons continue reading:

Abridge.woff2 Icon Font is a subset of Font Awesome, and can be loaded like any other font by uncommenting the font in the `abridge/sass/font.scss` and including the font.css file in your stylesheet array defined in config.toml: `stylesheets = [ "abridge-switcher.css", "font.css", "iconfont.css" ]`

Abridge.woff2 file can be overridden just like any other Zola theme file, by placing your own Abridge.woff2 in your sites root eg: `mysite/static/font/Abridge.woff2`

To create your own Icon Font with other/more icons you can use the repository here: https://github.com/Jieiku/fontsubset

You will also need to add the additional icon entries to `abridge/sass/fonts/_Abridge.scss`

If you are running Abridge as a submodule, what you can do instead is copy `_Abridge.scss` as your own `mysite/sass/myfont.scss`, and then adjust your config.toml:

instead of this: `stylesheets = [ "abridge-switcher.css" ]` do this: `stylesheets = [ "abridge-switcher.css", "myfont.css" ]`


### Theme-Switcher

The theme switcher relies on javascript to work, it applies the .light class to the root documentElement. The file that handles this (theme.js) is tiny and optimized and it is the first file loaded in the head, so the performance hit is minimal, but it does still exist. Without the Theme switcher you can still use The automatic Theme, it works by using Browser/OS preference, you can even install a [Firefox plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/theme-switcher-for-firefox/) to quickly switch between the two. By default the demo has the theme switcher enabled so that it can be evaluated.

With the growing number of options and configuration it can get confusing. To disable the Theme Switcher, you would set `js_switcher = false` and comment out the Switcher section and enable your choice in the No switcher section, for example:

```toml
#################
# Resource Files
#################
js_switcher = false

########## Switcher ########## (comment this block out if NOT using switcher):
#stylesheets = [ "abridge-switcher.css" ] # Orange Automatic Dark/Light Theme based on browser/system preference with switcher
#stylesheets = [ "abridge-blue-switcher.css" ] # Blue Automatic Night/Light Theme based on browser/system preference with switcher
#stylesheets = [ "abridge-blueshade-switcher.css" ] # BlueShade Automatic Night/Light Theme based on browser/system preference with switcher
#stylesheets = [ "abridge-switcher.css", "font.css" ] # include your own font!
#stylesheets = [ "abridge-switcher.css", "iconfont.css" ] # include your own font icons!
#stylesheets = [ "abridge-switcher.css", "font.css", "iconfont.css" ] # include your own font, and font icons!

########## No Switcher ##########
stylesheets = [ "abridge.css" ] # Orange Automatic Dark/Light Theme based on browser/system preference
#stylesheets = [ "abridge-blue.css" ] # Blue Automatic Night/Light Theme based on browser/system preference
#stylesheets = [ "abridge-blueshade.css" ] # BlueShade Automatic Night/Light Theme based on browser/system preference
#stylesheets = [ "abridge-dark.css" ] # Orange Dark Theme
#stylesheets = [ "abridge-light.css" ] # Orange Light Theme
```

### Optimize PNG files:

All png files can be optimized using [oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng), this usually results in files 1/2 the size:

```bash
cd static
oxipng -o max --strip all -a -Z *.png
```

You can go even farther if you use leanify:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JayXon/Leanify
cd Leanify
make
sudo cp leanify /usr/local/bin/leanify
exit  #launch new terminal
leanify -i 7777 *.png
leanify -i 7777 *.ico
```

Results of using leanify on files previously processed with oxipng (smaller favicons compressed a lot more):

```bash
Processing: android-chrome-192x192m.png
2.23 KB -> 2.22 KB      Leanified: 11 B (0.48%)
Processing: android-chrome-192x192.png

### Pre gzip/brotli content to serve with nginx:

If you are serving your site with nginx, you can pre gzip your content.

First configure nginx:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

gzip on;
gzip_vary on;
gzip_proxied expired no-cache no-store private auth;
#gzip_proxied any;
gzip_comp_level 9;
gzip_buffers 64 16k;
#gzip_buffers 16 8k;
gzip_http_version 1.1;
gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript image/svg+xml application/xhtml+xml application/x-javascript application/x-font-ttf application/vnd.ms-fontobject font/opentype font/ttf font/eot font/otf;
#gzip_types text/plain text/css application/json application/javascript text/xml application/xml application/xml+rss text/javascript;
```

Then you can gzip/brotli your files:
```bash
zola build
find ~/.dev/abridge/public -type f -regextype posix-extended -regex '.*\.(htm|html|css|js|xml|xsl|txt|woff|woff2|svg|otf|eot|ttf)' -exec gzip --best -k -f {} \+ -exec brotli --best -f {} \;
rsync -zvrh ~/.dev/abridge/public/ web:/var/www/abridge
```

Nginx does not come by default with brotli support, but adding it was not difficult.

## Contributing and Philosophy

We'd love your help! Especially with fixes to issues.

The overall idea behind abridge is to be lightweight and fast, and to work properly even if javascript is disabled.

The only feature that some people may consider a necessity that relies on javascript is the Search.

Any feature added to abridge that relies on javascript will do so with it disabled by default.
