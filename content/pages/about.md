This site provides a demo for the [abridge theme](https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge) for [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) the static site generator.

Abridge was created by [Jake G (jieiku)](https://github.com/Jieiku) to be fast and lightweight, using semantic html, a class-light [abridge.css](https://github.com/Jieiku/abridge.css), and No Mandatory JS.

Nearly half of the existing Zola MIT themes were inspiration for features and design of this theme.

Abridge is licensed under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
